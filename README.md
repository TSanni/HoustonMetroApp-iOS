# Houston Metro 

This is an iOS application that's designed to help people get arrival times for the Houston Metro. Anyone that takes public transportation will benfit from the use of this application.

The main feature of this project is the Combine framework (a declarative Swift API for processing values over time). Without this, I would've had to approach the creation of this app in an entriely different way. 

Combine is used to subscribe to SwiftUI's published properties and update the UI when these values change. Combine is also used to perform network calls and gather data from the internet. 

Beyond that, MapKit is used to mark a chosen bus stop on a map, and Network is used to determine whether the user is connected to the Internet. 

[Houston Metro](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/houston-metro/id6470216676) is currently available on the App Store!
